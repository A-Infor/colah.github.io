  <p><i>
    Imagine a new disease that essentially all adults spend years suffering from.
    It strikes everyone -- men and women, the rich and poor, people of every race -- intermittently beginning as a teenager and continuing into adulthood.
  </i></p>

  <p><i>
    Most afflicted report that, at its worst, that it’s one of the most painful things they’ve experienced.
    About half of them report they’d rather accept a 50% chance of death, complete loss of hearing, or the loss of a limb, to living the rest of their life with the disease.
    About half of people who commit suicide report in suicide notes being motivated by the disease.
  </i></p>

  <p><i>But this new disease is neither new nor a disease: it’s romantic suffering.</i></p>

  <br>
  <br>

  <p>
    The above is dramatic and pretty epistemically questionable.
    It’s the most extreme plausible reading of the evidence, as I understand it, including surveys I ran that are probably poorly designed.
    But I think some drama may be warranted here.
  </p>

  <p>
    It seems to me that we may not be taking romantic suffering seriously enough.
    When someone suffers due to a disease, we rightly go to great lengths to help them.
    But when someone experiences romantic suffering, we give them ice cream and a dating app.
    If they continue to express pain, we begin to think less of them.
  </p>

  <p>
    This essay aims to make a plausibility argument that romance may be a promissing cause for altruistic intervention,
    synthesizing some academic literature and small experiments I ran myself.
    It's only intended a preliminary argument suggesting further research --
    I certainly wouldn't place high-confidence bets on any of this evidence!

  <p>
    I've broadly structured it in the form the <a>Importance, Tractability and Neglectedness</a> framework:

    Before going on, I wish to make one thing crystal clear: in arguing that romantic suffering may be a problem that society should take seriously,
    I am absolutely not saying that anyone is entitled to a relationship from anyone else.
    Instead, I think that we as a society should be helping everyone find relationships they enthusiastically wish to be in, including potentially helping people grow.

  <h2>First Order Effects</h2>

  <h3>Suicide</h3>

  <p>
    So far, we've considered the effect of romance on typical quality of life,
    and tried to extrapolate that into an estimate of the total burden of romatnic suffering.
    An alternative approach is to look to look at the extreme negative tail.
    We know the stereotype of people comitting suicide due to romantic suffering
    -- is that actually a major phenomenon, which could significantly contribute to our estimate?
  </p>

  <p>
    The answer seems to be that, yes, many people who commit suicide <i>percieve</i> themselves to be motivated by romance and relationships...
    but it's unclear to what extent it's actually causal.
  </p>

  <p>
    If we're interested in understanding the motivations of people who commit suicide,
    there's a small body of research around the analysis of suicide notes.
    They collect a corpus of suicide notes, and then analyze them to try to better understand the motivations of the decedents.
    Unfortunately many of these papers, including those explicitly studying the effect of romance on suicide,
    are unclear about metrics and don't report the most relevant statistics, so we'll have to do some guess work and estimation.
    They also only have sample sizes in the hundreds, and there could be a systematic bias in which decedents leave notes.
    Dspite this, it's the best tool we have.
  </p>

  <p>
    Depending on which studies you look at and how you interpret them,
    I think a conservative estimate is that ~20% of suicides are primarily motivated by romance,
    and a liberal reading could easily have it be a major factor in >50%.
  </p>

  <ul>
    <li>
      Delgado (2013), found that 22% of suicides for which they had notes were "motivated exclusively" by problems in a romantic relationship.
      I derived this number from 26% of decedents were "motivated exclusively by relationship problems" and 85% of those being "intimate relationships."
      Presumably, there are more suicides for which it was a major but non-exclusive factor, or where romantic loneliness was a factor but not a specific relationship.
    </li>

    <li>
      Canetto & Lester (2010) rated suicide notes from on an 11 point scale for how motivated they were by romance.
      They found a mean rating of 5.27 (SD = 3.74).
      Since no further inforation on the distribution is provided, we'll model it as a Gaussian.
      This would mean that, in their sample, 16% of decedents left notes that scored at least 9 out of 11 for romantic motivation.
      They don't define the scale, but even being very conservative 9 seems like it would be in the "primarily motivated by" regime.
      (For contrast, the mean rating for work-related motivations was only 2.38.)
      If you wanted to be less conservative, you could just say that 5.27/11 seems like a significant cause and estimate that 50% of decedants were signficantly motivated by romance.
    </li>

    <li>
      Lester, et al. (2004) report on the correlation between age and suicide being motivated by romance.
      but don't include any information besides the correlation, which is frustrating because they clearly had data on the prevelance of romance as a motivation!
    </li>

    <li>
      Several older studies I couldn't easily access are cited by Canetto & Lester (2010) as reporting that the "majority" or "typical" motivation for sucide in men is romance.
      (They are arguing that romance is an equal motivation for men and women, contrary to stereotype, so only citing evidence for men should not be read as it being especially common or men.)
    </li>
  </ul>

<p>
  A major complication with all this evidence is that what people feel and say they are motivated by does not necessarily align with the cause external observers attribute.
  An example of evidence pushing in this direction is Fishman and Weimann (1996) who observe that, in Israel, while media portrayals present suicide as being motivated by romance 16% of the time,
  official investigations by the Ministry of Health only find it to be the cause 1.2% of the time, generally finding suicide to be caused by mental illness.
</p>

<p>
  So it seems that many people who commit suicide feel they are doing it because of romance, but that professionals,
  from an outside perspective, often perceive the underlying cause to be depression or other mental health issues.
  I'm not sure how to interpret that.
  On the one hand, it could be that these people were depressed and their brain gave the explanation that the cause was romantic hardship.
  On the other hand, it could be that some were horribly hurt by romance, causing them to fall into depression and eventually commit suicide.
  (Or perhaps they are independent, compounding factors -- many researchers reject single cause interpretations of suicide.)
</p>

<p>
  The most satisfying resolution I've come up with is to do a naive estimate taking stated motivations on face value,
  and then multiply by an adjustment factor accounting for comorbidity with mental health issues.
  From calculations in the appendix, we estimate the life year per capita cost of suicide to be 0.38.
  If we take 20% of suicides to be "motivated by" romance, we get 0.076 life years per capita.
  Now, for our adjustment factor we want to account for both increased risk of future suicide on different motivations,
  and also decreased quality of life due to increased risk of mental health issues.
  But it should also account for the possibility that many people may have had depression caused by external factors which this resolves.
  In the end, I decided to go with a factor of 0.7 which I have no real justification for.
  This gives 0.05 life years lost per capita due to romance through effect on suicide.
</p>


  <h2>Second Order Effects</h2>

  <p>
    While the most obvious impact of improving the romance problem is the direct effect of improving people’s lives,
    there may also be significant second order effects.
    This is basically all speculation.
  </p>

  <p>
    Many of these estimates are framed in terms of productivity and economic output of the individuals affected.
    This may seem kind of cold -- why are we talking about the economic value of people whose lives we’re trying to help?
    But this is actually a standard lens for thinking about flow through effects of altruistic intervention.
    Economic value isn’t perfect, but it’s a natural way to try to analyze the value someone you help creates for their community.
  </p>

  <p>
    <b>Increased Productivity:</b>
    People in better romantic situations may be more productive.
    One reason you might expect this is improved emotional wellbeing.
    If someone isn’t sad and anxious about their romantic situation,
    they may be more able to excel in other parts of their life.
    Another reason is that they aren’t wasting energy unproductively looking for a partner,
    such as spending hours on dating websites.
  </p>

  <p>
    On the flip side, you could also imagine people with partners, and especially those with children, being less productive due to investing energy into their family.
    It seems to me that the net effect we should expect is unclear both in magnitude and direction.
    A compelling analysis would need to take into account not just the size of these effects,
    but estimates of counterfactuals, and how productivity changes over age.
  </p>

  <p>
    <b>Saved Life years:</b>
    If you buy the <a>suicide effect</a> from the first order effects section
    -- that some significant fraction of suicides are due to bad romantic situations --
    you should probably expect very significant flow through effects if the problem is resolved.
    The population of people committing suicide is disproportionately people who society has invested a lot in raising and educating, and now have high expected economic output.
    The counterargument is that people who were vulnerable to committing suicide may be suffering mental health conditions, which may reduce expected future contributions.
  </p>

  <!--TODO: estimates-->

  <p>
    <b>Romantic Collaborators:</b>
    There’s a small body of literature on collaboration (eg. in science) between romantic partners (TODO: Citations).
    My present guess is that these collaborations can be extremely meaningful to the people involved, but probably don’t have a very large effect on productivity.
  </p>

  <p>
    I think the most likely way it could be a large effect and we’re not seeing it is social disapproval causing people to not collaborate with their partners,
    or not be transparent about how it affects them.
    Another possibility is that collaboration isn’t quite the right lens,
    but there’s an effect more like emotional support.
  </p>

  <p>
    <b>Population Effects:</b>
    It’s possible that helping people find good relationships would affect fertility.
    I’m inclined to not weight this too highly because we have lots of independent interventions that affect population if we want to, including state support for families and immigration policy.
    On the other hand, it’s possible that improving relationships would increase the number of children growing up with parents who are in a good relationship, which seems exciting.
  </p>

  <h3>Reasons for Past Underestimation</h3>

  <p>
    If romance is so important for quality of life, why has it not been taken more seriously?
    Of course, in some ways it has been -- there’s a thriving industry of giving love advice,
    self help books, dating websites, marketing items as romantic gifts, and much more.
    But this doesn’t really look more like people going after a market opportunity than taking a problem seriously.
  </p>

  <!--TODO: Should some of the above go in the intro? -->

  <p>
    I think there’s a number of good reasons we might systematically underestimate the significance of romantic suffering.
    Most of the time, people experiencing romantic hardship have an incentive to downplay it,
    because expressing suffering would just make their situation worse by making them less attractive.
    A smaller fraction of the time, they may be tempted to exaggerate it (eg. to make a partner hesitate to leave),
    reducing the credibility of people who express suffering.

  <h2>Suicide life-year cost per capita</h2>

  <p>
    To estimate the number of life years lost to suicide per capita,
    I combine the CDC
    <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/data/dvs/LCWK1_2015.pdf">2015 leading causes of death by age group</a>
    data with <a href="https://www.ssa.gov/oact/STATS/table4c6.html">2015 life expectancy data</a>.
    For each age group, I multiply the suicide rate by the number of years in the age group and by life expectancy of the median age.
    This gives me estimates of how many life years are lost per capita per age group, which I sum for a full estimate.
    This is only a first-order estimate, and doesn't account for how suicide influences life expectancy.
    It does not attempt to account for comorbidity of suicide with mental health conditions.

    This leads to an estimate of <b>0.38 LY per capita</b>.
    You can think of this as meaning that, if suicide didn't exist, average life expectancy would increase by 0.38.

  </p>


  <p>
    One interesting observation is that, while suicide rate peaks in the 50-54 age group,
    the life year cost peaks in the 15-19 age group.
